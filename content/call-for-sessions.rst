Call for contributions
=======================

The theme of this conference is how we actually work and
"the problems we found along the way", not "advertising our product".
You can present ideas, what you couldn't do, things you need advice
on, and so on.  You can request time slots for lightning talks, normal
talks, posters or suggest a discussion session. 
If there are too many long talk requests, we will open a voting for the time 
to not have to decline any submitted talks. Only the length may change.

.. admonition:: RSE-FI vs SciComp teams

   You can submit to either part in advance, but

   * RSE-FI is more focused on advanced submissions
   * SciComp teams is more focused on being an `unconference
     <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>`__ (we collect ideas
     dynamically during the meeting and allocate time then)

Submit a contribution
----------------------

You'll be able to submit talks, demos, or posters you'd like to present.

Our facilities include one main room (reserved), one breakout room (reserved), 
and several informal spaces throughout the building’s lobby areas that can be used 
for smaller discussion sessions (not reserved).

**Selection process:**
We will review all submissions to make sure they align with the spirit of the event. 
Our goal is to accept as many contributions as possible. If there are too many long talks submitted, 
our plan is to let attendees vote and allocate time slots based on those votes. 
When submitting, please keep your abstract concise and accessible to a general audience.

In short: Your contribution will most likely be accepted, the main question is how much time you'll have to present.

Deadline for submissions to get into the program is January 20 end of day in Nordics.

You will get to know about the length of your talk on January 21. 


Contribution inspirations
---------------------------

**You are allowed to come with a question instead of a solution.**

* Introduction to how my team/organization works.
* Cool procedure/practice/tool we have developed.
* Cool software I have developed.
* Book/video/event review and summary.
* Problem or concern I am facing now.
* Demo or poster about something you would like to have input on.

You can request how long your session should be: lightning talk (10 min),
20 min talk, poster/demo spot. 
You will get to know your assigned length in time before the event.

Unconference
------------

We'll also set aside time for an unconference: sessions that can be proposed or requested 
on the spot during the event. Maybe you'll invite someone to run a session inspired by an 
informal coffee conversation, or you'll discover that several attendees are curious to hear 
more about something you're working on. 
The unconference time is meant exactly for those spontaneous, interest-driven sessions.
