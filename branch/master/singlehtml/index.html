<h3>History of NoBSC<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-nobsc" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You could say this event was first inspired when Richard Darst went to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170915060021/http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/">Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration conference in 2017</a>.
This event had a variety of infrastructure and open science people not
advertising why their stuff was so good, but discussion how to make
things better.  (At least that’s what it looks like with rose-colored
glasses looking back.)  This also kicked off the collaboration between
ASC and CodeRefinery (a NeIC project dedicated to teaching basic
software tools for researchers), which continues to this day.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery didn’t feel like a collaboration not between
organizations, but between the people in the trenches directly helping
or users.  This was an extremely productive collaboration, not just in
the main teaching but in connecting people together to talk about
their other jobs besides teaching.</p>
<p>In 2019, we had a meeting it Helsinki called <a class="reference external" href="https://nordichpc.github.io/2019-11-14-helsinki/">Nordic HPC</a>, basically a lot
of the CodeRefinery staff who were supporters of smaller
university-based computing clusters.  We enjoyed talking and sharing
ideas, but soon we became closer together because we were all working
online, and our <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/">collaboration was focused on online events</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2026, we met again in person - some of the same people, many
different people.  While it was ad-hoc and had no budget, it got the
job of “meeting each other” done.  The attendees wanted to continue,
and we currently plan to repeat the event next year in Tampere.</p>

<span id="document-call-for-sessions"></span><section id="call-for-contributions">
<h2>Call for contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#call-for-contributions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The theme of this conference is how we actually work and
“the problems we found along the way”, not “advertising our product”.
You can present ideas, what you couldn’t do, things you need advice
on, and so on.</p>
<section id="unconference">
<h3>Unconference<a class="headerlink" href="#unconference" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The meeting is mostly organnized as an “<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>”, with sessions
decided more dynamically by participants than usual rather than being
pre-selected by a panel.  This makes more emphasis on discussions and
less prepared talks, rather than flashy abstracts and slides.</p>
<p>Attendees will be able to suggest talks at the start of the meeting,
and there will be a session to organize these proposals into the
program.  We will also make a way to submit proposals in advance so
that they can be slightly better planned, but hopefully still maintain
the unconference sprit.</p>
<p>History shows that we’ll find at least some time for everything
someone wants to present.  The main question is how long to take
(lighting, talk, discussion, etc).</p>

<p>Nordic Basic Scientific Computing is a gathering of everyone
interested in supporting scientific computing (and a celebration of
the diverse work that makes it all possible).  The 2027 version is
currently planned to be held in Tampere in late January or early
February, 2027.</p>
