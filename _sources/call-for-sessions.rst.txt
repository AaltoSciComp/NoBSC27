Call for contributions
=======================

The theme of this conference is how we actually work and
"the problems we found along the way", not "advertising our product".
You can present ideas, what you couldn't do, things you need advice
on, and so on.


Unconference
------------

The meeting is mostly organnized as an "`unconference
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference>`__", with sessions
decided more dynamically by participants than usual rather than being
pre-selected by a panel.  This makes more emphasis on discussions and
less prepared talks, rather than flashy abstracts and slides.

Attendees will be able to suggest talks at the start of the meeting,
and there will be a session to organize these proposals into the
program.  We will also make a way to submit proposals in advance so
that they can be slightly better planned, but hopefully still maintain
the unconference sprit.

History shows that we'll find at least some time for everything
someone wants to present.  The main question is how long to take
(lighting, talk, discussion, etc).
