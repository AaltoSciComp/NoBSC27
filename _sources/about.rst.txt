* Richard Darst, Aalto University (co-lead)

The organizers welcome others to take part in planning, either in
short or long term.  We communicate via the `CodeRefinery chat, #NoBSC-org
channel <https://coderefinery.org/join/chat/>`__.  This is the same
place that Nordic-RSE people hang out.

History of NoBSC
----------------

You could say this event was first inspired when Richard Darst went to
the `Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration conference in 2017
<https://web.archive.org/web/20170915060021/http://neic2017.nordforsk.org/>`__.
This event had a variety of infrastructure and open science people not
advertising why their stuff was so good, but discussion how to make
things better.  (At least that's what it looks like with rose-colored
glasses looking back.)  This also kicked off the collaboration between
ASC and CodeRefinery (a NeIC project dedicated to teaching basic
software tools for researchers), which continues to this day.

CodeRefinery didn't feel like a collaboration not between
organizations, but between the people in the trenches directly helping
or users.  This was an extremely productive collaboration, not just in
the main teaching but in connecting people together to talk about
their other jobs besides teaching.

In 2019, we had a meeting it Helsinki called `Nordic HPC
<https://nordichpc.github.io/2019-11-14-helsinki/>`__, basically a lot
of the CodeRefinery staff who were supporters of smaller
university-based computing clusters.  We enjoyed talking and sharing
ideas, but soon we became closer together because we were all working
online, and our `collaboration was focused on online events
<https://coderefinery.org/workshops/past/>`__.

In February 2026, we met again in person - some of the same people, many
different people.  While it was ad-hoc and had no budget, it got the
job of "meeting each other" done.  The attendees wanted to continue,
and we currently plan to repeat the event next year in Tampere.
